\section{Assignment Description}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Solve the following Reinforcement Learning tasks with Neuroevolution.
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item Single Pole Balancing with Velocities
			\item Double Pole Balancing with Velocities
			\item Double Pole Balancing without Velocities
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Compare a standard approach to the ESP algorithm in (c).
	\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}
		\item The task is ``solved'' if the poles does not fall for 1000 time steps.
		\item A 1 and 2 pole balancing simulator function is attached. Given a state and a command it computes the state at the next time step. Examples are included (help: onePole, twoPole). \\\textit{Note:} there is only one 2 pole balancing function, in the case without velocities it is up to you to ``blind'' you ANN of these states, but they are required by the simulator to compute what happens in the next time step.		
		\item You are responsible for all other code, including the ANN.
		\item Additional resources for ESP are available on the LEA
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{\textit{Genotype Size}} = \color{red}(3+1)*5 + 5*4 = 40\color{blue}
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{GA related changes:}

\end{enumerate}
\color{black}
	\item (25 pts) Describe the ESP approach, how it differs from above, and other details, including hyperparameters.
	\color{blue}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{ESP Approach:}
	Repeat the below steps for a fixed number of Generations.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Initialization:}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Number of nodes in the topology is decided.
	\item A sub-population is created for each of the nodes.
	\item Each individual in a sub-population represents a vector of weights, corresponding to the node(to which the sub-population belongs).	
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Evaluation:}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Select an individual randomly from each subpopulation and create a network from the chosen individuals.
	\item Test the generated network activation on the task and get the fitness of the network.
	\item This fitness value is added to each individuals cumulative fitness.
	\item Repeat this till each individual in each subpopulation has participated in k=5 trials.
	\item Get average fitness of each individual by dividing the cumulative fitness of each individual by number of times that individual participated in the network creation.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Recombination:}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Top quartile of each subpopulation is recombined with an individual whose fitness is greater than or equal to its fitness.
	\item The recombined individuals replace the lowest half of the subpopulation.
	  
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{ESP vs Basic RNN(with GA):}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item In ESP, the individuals(single node in the network) in each subpopulation are optimized in such a way that when they form the network, the combined network performs well.
	\item In RNN, the the network itself is evolved as a whole overtime rather than evolving each node in the network.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{ESP hyperparameters:}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Sub Population Size:} 10
	\item \textbf{Minimum number of trails per individual} : 5
	\item \textbf{Maximum Generations:} 1000
	\item \textbf{Selection Pressure:} 2
	\item \textbf{Crossover Probability:} 1
	\item \textbf{Mutation Probability:} 3/nGenes\\
	where \textbf{nGenes} = (number of inputs + number of hidden nodes) = (3 + 5) = 8 in our case.
 	\end{enumerate}
 	\item Basic RNN hyperparameters(with GA) are as described above.
 	\item The network topology for the ESP is also same as the one used in the Basic RNN(with GA) described above.
	\end{itemize}
	\color{black}
	\item (10 pts) Plot the fitness progress of both approaches over 10 runs, including significance
	\item ( 5 pts) Upload the weight matrix of your most successful solution in 2 files called: \textit{dpbnv.mat} and \textit{dpbnv\_esp.mat}
